# Calendar app

## Description

This project is an web application that utilises third-party API to retrieve weather information and displays the data in the browser.
The application will retrieve weather data of the desired city based on user's input, and display current/future weather predictions. A list of search history will be generated and displayed on the left side of the page to allow user to retrieve this information. Weather data are stored in the local storage and can be reloaded as needed.

You can access the application at https://sandy5433.github.io/Weather-dashboard/


## Usage

Below is a screenshot of the deployed webpage

Enter the desired city in the search bar on the top left corner and hit "Search". The current weather condition will be displayed across the top of the page. 5-Day Forecast is displayed below the current weather conditions. This search history will also be printed on the side bar which can be retrieved by clicking on the city button.
